# Capstone-Files

This repository is dedicated to the code for the Capstone project. 
It includes the training and validation codes for all the three architectures (that use Keras and Pytorch). 

Keras-based models are demonstrated in the Jupyter notebook.


The ResNet training requires specifying the following parameters (see the description in the console file): 

```
total_samples, batch_size, random_sampler, num_epochs, num_blocks, name
```
